# MessageReceived
Global Game Jam 2018. Team of 3. 

The theme of the game jam for this year was transmission. 
We decided we wanted to make a game about transmitting a message across planets, in a future not far away. 

The game was made using unity, for android. C#. 

MessageReceived is a puzzle solving game and a word puzzle game where you have to solve the riddle of the level, 
before figuring out what the correct order of the satellites are to transmit the message.

Use the satellites to spell out the answer to the riddle. Click on a satellite to rotate it.
Click on the planet at the bottom to send out the message. 

After the conclusion of the game jam, we decided we'd like to revisit this project and continue working on it, to hopefully
publish it to the play store. 
Some areas we'd like to improve on are: 
- simplify game play, get rid of the riddles and have the game be a puzzle game only
- get rid of the UI bar that appears when rotating satellites, have it so that you can drag anywhere on screen to rotate
- expand the level beyond the bounds of the screen, maybe drag the screen to move around a larger level
- add obstacles to the game, such as blackholes and moving asteroids
- add different types of satellites, eg: delay satellites and moving satellites
